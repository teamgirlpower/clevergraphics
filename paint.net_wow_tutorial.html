<h1>Paint.net Wow effect</h1> 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>
<img src="images/tutorials/Wow tutorial1.JPG" width="100%"/>
  
Start up Paint.Net. You can leave the canvas at its default size (800x600).
With the <b> Rectangle Select</b> selection tool draw a rectangle across the canvas.
About 1/3 in size.
The 9-ball has a yellow ribbon, so choose yellow from the <b>Colors</b> window and with the <b>Paint Bucket</b> tool fill the rectangle.
Now <b>Deselect</b> the selection and add a new layer.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

On this second layer, with the <b>Ellipse Select</b> tool, draw a circle.
Hold down the shift key while you drag to make a perfect circle.
With the <b>Move Selection</b> tool (the white arrow) you can position the selection in the middle. 
Fill the selection with the <b>Paint Bucket</b> tool with white (right-click will use the secondary color).
Again <b>Deselect</b> and add a new layer.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

On the third layer we'll add the number.
For this just use the <b>Text</b> tool.
I used Arial, size 84, bold and underlined (sometimes it's underlined sometimes not, I googled ;) )
You'll notice a small cross at the bottom-right of the text, use this to position it better.

when you're satisfied about the result you can flatten the image. This puts everything on one layer.
You'll find it in the menu Image --> Flatten, or use Ctrl+Shift+F.

<h2> Step 4 </2>

No really, this is so easy you'll wonder if an instructable is even necessary.

If the plugin was correctly installed, you'll have a Shape 3D menu item in Effects-->Render.
Choose this to start the plugin.

In the <b> Texture Map </b> (top-right) choose <b>Plane Map</b> (Scalable).
That's it, instant ball effect.
You can play with the <b>Object Rotation</b> and <b>Lighting</b> settings for a nicer effect

<h2> step 5 </h2>

A plus for Paint.Net is, that it remembers the last settings used.
So it's really easy to make all the other pool balls.

Undo a few steps, to just before you flattened the image, back to 3 layers.
Change the color of the background layer, the number on the third layer and apply the Shape3D effect again. The settings are still the same, so you can make all balls look alike.
